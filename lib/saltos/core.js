 * @type => the type used when create the container element
 * @html => contains the html code that you want to use as template
 *
 * The main use is only using the html argument and omiting the type, in this case, the
 * type used will be a div, but if you want to create a fragment of object, for example
 * as tr or td, you need to specify that the coontainer type used to create the objects
 * must to be a table or tr, is you don't specify the type, the div container creates
 * a breaked portion of the element and they don't works as expected because the DOM
 * builded is bad, you can see this problem in action when work with tables and try to
 * create separate portions of the table as trs or tds.
